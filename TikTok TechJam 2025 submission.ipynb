            "    Reasoning: This feature requires geo-specific compliance logic because it involves the disabling of autoplay for minors or users in California. The client-side app checks a user-age-preference service, which suggests that the system is aware of the user's age and location. This implies that the system needs to be aware of the user's location to apply the geo-specific compliance logic. Therefore, it is likely that the system needs to use geo-compliance logic to determine whether the autoplay feature should be enabled or disabled based on the user's location. \n",
